# javascript


JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995

JavaScript was previously used mainly for making webpages interactive such as form validation, animation, etc. Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:

    Using console tab of web browsers
    Using Node.js
    By creating web pages


1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers

All the popular web browsers have built-in JavaScript engines. Hence, you can run JavaScript on a browser. To run JavaScript on a browser,

    Open your favorite browser (here we will use Google Chrome).
    Open the developer tools by right clicking on an empty area and select Inspect. Shortcut: F12.
    On the developer tools, go to the console tab. Then, write JavaScript code and press enter to run the code.
